    		  To understand a bit better why this website was formed its important to know what the Corona virus is (formally known as Covid-19).
    		  The corona virus is a virus that affects the respiratory system in living organisms such as humans and animals.
    		  The virus can cause illnesses that range from a minor flu to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome(SARS).The Cornoa Virus emerged Mid November of 2019 and was first spotted in Wuhan,China. Numbers started rising and by March 2020, this virus started a world-wide pandemic.
    		   <br>
    		   <br>
    		   The virus got to South Africa in March and this has made a huge impact in our country. From people losing jobs, people dying and has also
    		   made an emotional and psychological impact on the people of South Africa. As citizens of South Africa we have started this initiative to
    		   try and help a few families that have been affected by this pandemic in our society.
